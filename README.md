# Tutti: Your Personal DJ

> Tutti is a simple system music player, but with a twist!

Tutti is a simple demonstration of how music players can be improved. Most often you may want to listen to a certain 'type' of song(s) but you don't want to take hours to make a perfect playlist to do so, but you're not going to put your song on shuffle right?

So I decided to create a music player that leverages the power or artificial intelligence and deep learning to create a model that runs over your songs and caches their HSA (Happy, Sad, Angry) values. This allows the program to utilize the song you are currently listening to and reference it against the entire cache to find the next closed song with a similar HSA value, thus allowing you to listen freely and without worry of getting that random song that you didn't feel like listening to :)
